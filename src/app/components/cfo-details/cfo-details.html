        Mr. Nishant Ojha is a visionary entrepreneur and business leader with
        extensive experience in building scalable organizations, driving

        I began my career in 2005 with Intai Technology in the telecom sector. As a B.Tech (CSE) graduate with an MBA in HR & Marketing, I was entrusted with the responsibility of recruitment and candidate shortlisting. During this journey, I realized something important—most candidates did not fully understand the value of a job. They were unsure of what to do, how to do it, and, above all, why they should pursue a job. The lack of clarity about their mission and objectives often held them back from achieving true growth.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-6 text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        To address this gap, I joined GNext India Solution, where I worked extensively on career guidance. I visited various colleges and universities, interacted with students directly, and helped them discover the right path through proper guidance.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-6 text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        In 2019, I became a part of UPSDM, where skill training and placement were the core objectives. This experience solidified my belief that recruitment should not be limited to filling vacancies but should focus on preparing and guiding candidates to find careers aligned with their strengths and aspirations.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-6 text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        With this vision, in December 2024, I co-founded Sarvsiddh Management Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. along with my partner. Our mission is simple yet impactful—

      <p class="mt-6 text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">

      <p class="mt-6 text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        At Sarvsiddh, we believe in creating the perfect match between companies and candidates. Because when the right talent meets the right opportunity, both flourish.
